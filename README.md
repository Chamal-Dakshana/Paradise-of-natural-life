Problem – 
●	There is no easy way for people who dedicate themselves to protect the wonderful creations of nature such as forests, water sources, animals, etc. to collect the funds they need. Also, there is no reliable place where people who want to participate in such good projects can easily donate money.


Solution-


●	We have created a website to solve the above-mentioned problem. Through this, any organization or individual can send us their projects and collect the required funds. The public can choose the amount they wish to donate and donate.
